# Huddle landing page with a single introductory section

This repository contains an implementation of one of the Frontend Mentor Challenges - [Huddle landing page with a single introductory section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0).

## Foreword

I have gained quite significant CSS experience over years whilst building various landing pages and projects of various complexities.

But I would hardly consider myself a master and I see the Frontend Mentor Challenges as a great way how to become one. Therefore I decide to solve as many of them as possible.

## Implementation

Personally, I am a big fan of traditional CSS. Its new extensions like variables help to make it more usable even without using preprocessors like SASS or LESS.

But it still makes a sense to use these preprocessors, to make styles even more robusts, especially for purely static landing pages such as one in this challenge.

However, a lot of projects also use Tailwind as a prefered choice. With things like PostCSS and other modern tooling the developer experience is quite great, especially when developers are familiar with standard CSS.

Therefore, I decided to implement this landing project both in [SASS (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).
