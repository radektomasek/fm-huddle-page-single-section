# Huddle landing page with a single introductory section

This repository contains an implementation of one of the Frontend Mentor Challenges - [Huddle landing page with a single introductory section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0) using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Overview

I have gained quite significant CSS experience over years whilst building various landing pages and projects of various complexities.

Using vanilla CSS is fun, especially when mixed with things like [SASS (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/), but I quite like the utility-first approach too.

It was quite a dilema to decide which approach to choose for these challenges on the [https://www.frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io), but in the end, I dediced to go with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which should be quite elegant and suitable solution for most of the challenges there.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - TailwindCSS for styles
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) - a simple, zero config builder
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - This repo contains a simple automation that pushes the static site into an S3 bucket.

### What I learned

In the past, I was using Flexbox for creating overall page layouts like these. However, I learned about some benefits why Grid could be a better option for an overrall layout.
In a nutshell, writing layouts in Grid require less code than Flexbox alternative, therefore there is less maintenance necessary.

And one of the main learning was to start using Grid on the layout as well as keeping Flexbox for smaller pieces.
